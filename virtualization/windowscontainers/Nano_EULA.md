MICROSOFT LICENSE TERMS FOR A VIRTUAL HARD DISK IMAGE OF THE FOLLOWING SOFTWARE:
MICROSOFT WINDOWS SERVER

---------------------

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software product identified above and any documentation, which includes the media on which you received it (collectively referred to as the "software" or "VHD"). The terms also apply to any Microsoft Internet-based services for this software.

**BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, USING SOME FEATURES ALSO OPERATES AS YOUR CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN STANDARD COMPUTER INFORMATION FOR INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.
YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE SOFTWARE IS LIMITED TO A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. PLEASE REFER TO SECTION 3 FOR DETAILS.**

---------------------

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1.	**INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**
  *  Supersede other terms. 
  The terms of this license supersede the terms of any Microsoft software license term agreement that requires “acceptance” of a separate license term agreement during installation. 
  * Installation. 
  You may install and use the software on your device of which you are running any virtualization software able to run Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) formats, including Microsoft Virtual Server. 
  *  Limited use rights.
  You may use the software in the virtual hard disk image only to internally demonstrate and evaluate it. You may not use the software in a live operating environment. 
  *  No separation.
  The Microsoft software in the virtual hard disk image is licensed as a single piece of software. The software may include tools and components to support new features of the operating system. You may not separate, use, or redistribute these tools or components for any purpose other than for use by those new features that are distributed as part of the operating system. For example, Service Fabric is a software component that may be used by the Network Controller of the operation system only.
  *  Third party programs
  The software may contain third party software programs that are licensed under proprietary terms that are presented to you. The software may also contain third party open source programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under Microsoft’s license terms. Notices, if any, for the third party open source programs are included for your information only. 

2.	**INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.**
  Microsoft may provide Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time. Should the Virtual Hard Drive Image be configured to transmit over the Internet the following terms apply:
  Consent for Internet-Based Services. Because this software is a pre-release version, we have turned on some internet-based features by default to obtain feedback about them. The software features described below and in the Windows Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=506737. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information to any country Microsoft operates in. The list below may not be fully-inclusive.
  Computer Information. Some software features use Internet protocols, which send to Microsoft (or its suppliers or service providers) computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you, in accordance with the Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=506737.

3.	**TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.**
  The software will stop running on a predetermined date. You will not receive any other notice. You may not be able to access data used with the software when it stops running. Please see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=624232 for specific information about the end date for the software.. 

4.	**NO ACTIVATION.**
  To prevent its unlicensed use, the software may contain activation enforcement technology. Because this is an evaluation-only license, you are not licensed to activate the software for any purpose even if it prompts you to do so.

5.	**PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.**
  This software is a pre-release version. It may not work the way a final version of the software will. We may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version.

6.	**FEEDBACK.**
  If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose.  You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement. 

7.	**.NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE.**
  The software includes one or more components of the .NET Framework, which you may use only as described at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=66406, if you use the .NET Framework components to conduct internal benchmark testing.

8.	**H.264/AVC AND MPEG-4 VISUAL STANDARDS AND VC-1 AND MPEG-2 VIDEO STANDARDS**
  This software may include H.264/AVC, VC-1, and MPEG-4 Part 2, and MPEG-2 visual compression technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice:
  
  THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC, THE VC-1, THE MPEG-4 PART 2 VISUAL, AND THE MPEG-2 VIDEO PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (“VIDEO STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, VC-1, MPEG-4 PART 2 AND MPEG-2 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C SEE WWW.MPEGLA.COM.

9.	**ADOBE FLASH PLAYER**
  The software may include a version of Adobe Flash Player. You agree that your use of the Adobe Flash Player is governed by the license terms for Adobe Systems Incorporated, at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248532. Adobe and Flash are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries.
10.	**SCOPE OF LICENSE.**
  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights 	to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights 	despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In 	doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it 	in certain ways. You may not
  *  Disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software, other than the Microsoft .NET Framework (see separate term above), to any third party without Microsoft’s prior written approval;
  *  work around any technical limitations in the software;
  *  reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
  *  make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
  *  publish the software for others to copy;
  *  rent, lease, or lend the software;
  *  transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
  *  use the software for commercial software hosting services.

  You also may not remove, minimize, block or modify any logos, trademarks, copyright, digital watermarks, or other notices of Microsoft or its suppliers that are included in the software, including any content made available to you through the software.

  Rights to access the software on any device do not give you any right to implement Microsoft patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in software or devices that access that device.

11.	**EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.**
  The software is subject to United States export laws and 	regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that 	apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For 	additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

12.	**SUPPORT SERVICES.**
  Because this software is “as is,” Microsoft may not provide support services 	for it.

13.	**ENTIRE AGREEMENT.**
  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

14.	**APPLICABLE LAW.**
  a.	United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
  b.	Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

15.	**LEGAL EFFECT.**
  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under 	the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you 	acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if 	the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

16.	**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.**

17.	**LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

  This limitation applies to
  *  anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
  *  claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

  It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. If your local law allows you to recover other damages from Microsoft even though we do not, you cannot recover more than $5.00 USD, or the amount you paid for the software, whichever is higher.

**EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE.** Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.

La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

**LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES.**  Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage.  Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

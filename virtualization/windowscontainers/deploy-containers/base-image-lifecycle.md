# Base image servicing lifecycles

> Applies to: Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

> [!Note]
> Microsoft has delayed the scheduled end of support and servicing dates for a number of products to help people and organizations focus their attention on retaining business continuity. See [Lifecycle changes to end of support and servicing dates](/lifecycle/announcements/lifecycle-changes-eos-servicing-dates) for more information.

Windows container base images are based on either Long-Term Servicing Channel releases or Semi-Annual Channel releases of Windows Server. This article explains how long support will last for different versions of base images from both channels.

The Semi-Annual Channel is a twice-per-year feature update release with eighteen-month servicing timelines for each release. This lets customers take advantage of new operating system capabilities at a faster pace, both in applications (particularly those built on containers and microservices) and in the software-defined hybrid data center. For more information, see the [Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel overview](/windows-server/get-started/semi-annual-channel-overview).

For Server Core images, customers can also use the Long-Term Servicing Channel that releases a new major version of Windows Server every two to three years. Long-Term Servicing Channel releases receive five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support. This channel works with systems that require a longer servicing option and functional stability.

The following table lists each type of base image, its servicing channel, and how long its support will last.

|Base image                       |Servicing channel|Version|OS build|Availability|Mainstream support end date|Extended support date|

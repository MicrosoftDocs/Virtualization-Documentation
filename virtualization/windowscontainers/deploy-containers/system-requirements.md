# Windows container requirements

> Applies to: Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016; Azure Stack HCI, versions 21H2 and 20H2, Windows 10, Windows 11

This guide lists the requirements for a Windows container host.

## Operating system requirements

- The Windows container feature is available on Windows Server 2016 and later, Windows 10 Professional and Enterprise Editions (version 1607 and later), and Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise.
- The Hyper-V role must be installed before running Hyper-V isolation.
- Windows Server Container hosts must have Windows installed to c:\. This restriction does not apply if only Hyper-V isolated containers will be deployed.

## Virtualized container hosts

If you're running a Windows container host from a Hyper-V virtual machine, and also hosting Hyper-V isolation, you need to enable nested virtualization. Nested virtualization has the following requirements:

- At least 4 GB RAM available for the virtualized Hyper-V host.
- A processor with Intel VT-x (this feature is currently available for Intel and AMD processors).
- The container host VM also needs at least two virtual processors.

### Memory requirements

You can configure restrictions on available memory for containers through [resource controls](../manage-containers/resource-controls.md) or by overloading a container host. The minimum amount of memory required to launch a container and run basic commands (`ipconfig`, `dir`, and so on) are listed below.

> [!NOTE]
> These values don't take into account resource sharing between containers or requirements from the application running in the container. For example, a host with 512 MB of free memory can run multiple Server Core containers under Hyper-V isolation because those containers share resources.

# Windows container requirements

This guide lists the requirements for a Windows container host.

## Operating system requirements

- The Windows container feature is available on Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 10 Professional and Enterprise Editions (version 1607 and later).
- The Hyper-V role must be installed before running Hyper-V isolation
- Windows Server Container hosts must have Windows installed to c:\. This restriction does not apply if only Hyper-V isolated containers will be deployed.

## Virtualized container hosts

If a Windows container host will be run from a Hyper-V virtual machine, and will also be hosting Hyper-V isolation, nested virtualization will need to be enabled. Nested virtualization has the following requirements:

- At least 4 GB RAM available for the virtualized Hyper-V host.
- Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, or Windows 10 on the host system; and Windows Server (Full or Server Core) in the virtual machine.
- A processor with Intel VT-x (this feature is currently available for Intel and AMD processors).
- The container host VM will also need at least two virtual processors.

### Memory requirements

Restrictions on available memory to containers can be configured though [resource controls](../manage-containers/resource-controls.md) or by overloading a container host.  The minimum amount of memory required to launch a container and run basic commands (ipconfig, dir, and so on) are listed below.

>[!NOTE]
>These values don't take into account resource sharing between containers or requirements from the application running in the container.  For example a host with 512MB of free memory can run multiple Server Core containers under Hyper-V isolation because those containers share resources.

#### Windows Server 2016

| Base image  | Windows Server container | Hyper-V isolation    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Nano Server | 40 MB                     | 130 MB + 1 GB Pagefile |
| Server Core | 50 MB                     | 325 MB + 1 GB Pagefile |

#### Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel)

| Base image  | Windows Server container | Hyper-V isolation    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Nano Server | 30 MB                     | 110 MB + 1 GB Pagefile |
| Server Core | 45 MB                     | 360 MB + 1 GB Pagefile |

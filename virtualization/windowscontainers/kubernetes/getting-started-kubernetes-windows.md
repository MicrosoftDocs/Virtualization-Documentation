# Kubernetes on Windows

> [!TIP]
> Curious to find out which Kubernetes features are supported on Windows today? Please see [officially supported features](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#supported-functionality-and-limitations) for more details.

This page serves as an overview for getting started with Kubernetes on Windows.

### Try out Kubernetes on Windows

See [deploying Kubernetes on Windows](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-hci-evaluation-guide) for instructions on how to manually install Kubernetes on Windows in the environment of your choice.

### Scheduling Windows containers

See [scheduling Windows containers in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/user-guide/) for best practices and recommendations on scheduling Windows containers in Kubernetes.

### Deploying Kubernetes on Windows in Azure

The [Windows containers on Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/windows-container-cli) guide makes this easy. If you are looking to deploy and manage all the Kubernetes components yourself, see our [step-by-step walkthrough](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/topics/windows.md) using the open-source `AKS-Engine` tool.

### Troubleshooting

Please see [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](./common-problems.md) for a suggested list of workarounds and solutions to known issues.

# Get started: Prep Windows for containers

In this quickstart, you see various approaches for building a container-ready environment on Windows and Windows Server. You also install a container runtime.

Containers provide a lightweight, isolated environment that makes apps easier to develop, deploy, and manage. Before you can use a container, you need to set up an appropriate runtime.

This quickstart applies to Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows 11, and Windows 10.

## Prerequisites

The environment you need for this quickstart depends on your operating system (OS).

### Windows 10 and Windows 11

To run containers on Windows 10 or Windows 11, you need the following environment:

- One physical computer system running Windows 11 or Windows 10 with Anniversary Update (version 1607) or later
- Professional or Enterprise edition
- [Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/System-requirements-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows) enabled

Windows Server containers use Hyper-V isolation by default on Windows 10 and Windows 11 to provide developers with the same kernel version and configuration that's used in production. For more information about Hyper-V isolation, see [Isolation Modes](../manage-containers/hyperv-container.md).

### Windows Server

To run Windows Server containers in development environments, you need a physical server or virtual machine (VM) running Windows Server.

For testing, you can download a copy of [Windows Server 2025 Evaluation](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2025) or a [Windows Server Insider Program preview](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/for-business-getting-started-server).

## Select an approach

The approach you take to construct a container-ready environment depends on your OS. It also depends on other factors, such as the complexity and cost of implementation.

### Windows 10 and Windows 11

On Windows 10 and Windows 11 Professional and Enterprise editions, you can use Docker Desktop to run containerized apps. Docker Desktop provides a way for you to manage containers, apps, and images.

### Windows Server

For many applications and orchestration patterns, you need to build and deploy your own custom VMs. With the [transition of support](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/containers/updates-to-the-windows-container-runtime-support/2788799) for the Windows container runtime to Mirantis, the container runtime is no longer provided as part of a marketplace VM offering. The remainder of this guide shows you how to build a VM for Azure with the container runtime installed and ready to go.

Azure continues to offer a complete and fully managed end-to-end experience through Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) both in the cloud and on-premises. AKS and Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI are fully managed services with lower management overhead than custom deployments. Support for the container runtime is included within the AKS and Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI services under your Azure subscription.

- [Deploy a Windows Server container on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI](/azure/aks/learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-cli)
- [Set up an Azure Kubernetes Service host on Azure Local and Windows Server and deploy a workload cluster using PowerShell](/azure/aks/aksarc/kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell)

Other options also exist for making the experience of constructing your container-ready Azure VMs as smooth as possible. Two examples are Azure VM Image Builder and custom script extensions. When you compare options, keep the following points in mind. It's up to your organization to decide which aspect to optimize.

- How complex is it to implement?
- What is the cost?
- How does it impact my workload in production?

The following subsections discuss the pros and cons of VM Image Builder and custom script extensions, and show you how to get started.

#### VM Image Builder

The benefit to using VM Image Builder is that the configuration is done during a build time and doesn't have any effect on your workload at runtime. When the VM scale set instantiates a new VM from your custom image, the image is already prepped, and it's ready to run containers.

VM Image Builder, however, can be more complex to implement than script extensions, and there are more steps involved. Also, the VM Image Builder service is free, but you must pay for the compute, storage, and networking usage that's associated with the build process. For more information, see [Costs](/azure/virtual-machines/image-builder-overview#costs).

For a detailed, step-by-step procedure for building your own Windows Server VM image, see [Create a Windows VM by using Azure VM Image Builder](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/image-builder). To install your container runtime of choice, use the PowerShell scripts in this guide.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to cache the container images you plan to use locally on the VM. This practice helps improve the container start time after deployment. For scripts that help with this task, see [Windows Server](#windows-server-2), later in this quickstart.

#### Custom script extensions

Custom script extensions are quicker to implement than a VM Image Builder solution. The only cost associated with extensions is the price of storing the script in Azure or GitHub. However, the script can only run after a VM is provisioned. As a result, your budget must include extra time to prep the VM at scale-out time.

Using the scripts offered in this guide, configure your VM scale sets to install the container runtime of your choice after provisioning. To use a custom script extension to automate the process of installing apps on Azure VMs, see [Tutorial: Install applications in Virtual Machine Scale Sets with the Azure CLI](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/tutorial-install-apps-cli).

## Install the container runtime

The procedure you use to install a container runtime depends on your OS.

### Windows 10 and Windows 11

To install Docker on Windows 10 or Windows 11 Professional and Enterprise editions, take the following steps:

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), and create a Docker account if you don't already have one. You can create a free Docker account for personal or small business users. However, for larger businesses, there's a monthly fee. For detailed information, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install).

1. During installation, set the default container type to Windows containers. To switch the type after the installation finishes, take one of the following steps:

   - Run the following command in a PowerShell prompt:

     ```console
     & $Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe -SwitchDaemon
     ```

   - Use the Docker item in the Windows system tray, as shown in the following screenshot:

     :::image type="content" source="media/docker-for-win-switch.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Docker system tray menu. The Switch to Windows containers command is selected.":::

### Windows Admin Center

To use Windows Admin Center to set up a Windows Server machine as a container host, take the following steps:

1. In Windows Admin Center, ensure that you have the latest Containers extension installed. For more information about installing and configuring extensions, see the [Windows Admin Center documentation](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/overview).

1. Open the Windows Server machine that you want to configure.

1. On the side panel, under **Tools**, select **Containers**.

1. Select **Install**.

   Windows Admin Center starts the configuration of Windows Server and Docker in the background.

1. After the process is complete, refresh the page to see other functionality of the Containers extension.

### Windows Server

To run a Windows container, you must have a supported container runtime available on your machine. The runtimes currently supported on Windows are [Moby](https://mobyproject.org), the [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime), and [containerd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#containerd).

This section shows you how to install each runtime on a VM that runs Windows Server. For the Moby and containerd runtimes, you can use PowerShell scripts to complete the installation in a few steps.

<!-- start tab view -->
#### [Docker CE / Moby](#tab/dockerce)

Docker Community Edition (Docker CE) provides a standard runtime environment for containers. The environment offers a common API and command-line interface. The framework and components of Docker CE are managed by the open-source community as part of the [Moby Project](https://mobyproject.org/).

To get started with Docker on Windows Server, use the following command to run the [install-docker-ce.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-DockerCE/install-docker-ce.ps1) PowerShell script. This script configures your environment to enable container-related OS features. The script also installs the Docker runtime.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-DockerCE/install-docker-ce.ps1" -o install-docker-ce.ps1
.\install-docker-ce.ps1
```

For detailed information about configuring Docker Engine, see [Docker Engine on Windows](../manage-docker/configure-docker-daemon.md).

#### [Mirantis Container Runtime](#tab/mirantiscontainerruntime)

The Mirantis Container Runtime, formally known as Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE), provides the same functionality as Docker CE plus extra features built specifically for enterprise deployments. For instructions for installing this runtime, see [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/).

#### [containerd](#tab/containerd)

The [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) back end is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It's available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, and it can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system. This runtime offers functionality for image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, and other container management tasks.

The [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) tool is a Docker-compatible command-line interface for containerd.

Use the following command to run the [install-containerd-runtime.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-ContainerdRuntime/install-containerd-runtime.ps1) PowerShell script. This script installs containerd, nerdctl, and container-related OS features.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-ContainerdRuntime/install-containerd-runtime.ps1" -o install-containerd-runtime.ps1
.\install-containerd-runtime.ps1
```

The *install-containerd-runtime.ps1* script also installs [Windows Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-ins](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-networking). But you need to configure the ctr and nerdctl command-line interface tools to use the CNI configuration that best suits you.

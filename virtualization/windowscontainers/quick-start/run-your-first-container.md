# Get started: Run your first Windows container

This topic describes how to run your first Windows container, after setting up your environment as described in [Get started: Prep Windows for containers](./set-up-environment.md). To run a container, you first install a base image, which provides a foundational layer of operating system services to your container. Then you create and run a container image, which is based upon the base image. For details, read on.

## Install a container base image

All containers are created from container images. Microsoft offers several starter images, called base images, to choose from (for more details, see [Container base images](../manage-containers/container-base-images.md)). This procedures pulls (downloads and installs) the lightweight Nano Server base image.

1. Open a command prompt window (such as the built-in command prompt, PowerShell, or [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)), and then run the following command to download and install the base image:

   ```console
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > If you see an error message that says `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`, make sure Docker isn't configured to run Linux containers.

2. After the image is finished downloading—read the [EULA](../images-eula.md) while you wait—verify its existence on your system by querying your local docker image repository. Running the command `docker images` returns a list of installed images.

   Here's an example of the output showing the Nano Server image.

   ```console
   REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   microsoft/nanoserver   latest              105d76d0f40e        4 days ago          652 MB
   ```

## Run a Windows container

For this simple example, a ‘Hello World’ container image will be created and deployed. For the best experience, run these commands in an elevated command prompt window (but don't use the Windows PowerShell ISE—it doesn't work for interactive sessions with containers, as the containers appear to hang).

1. Start a container with an interactive session from the `nanoserver` image by entering the following command in your command prompt window:

   ```console
   docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 cmd.exe
   ```
2. After the container is started, the command prompt window changes context to the container. Inside the container, we'll create a simple ‘Hello World’ text file and then exit the container by entering the following commands:

   ```cmd
   echo "Hello World!" > Hello.txt
   exit
   ```

3. Get the container ID for the container you just exited by running the [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) command:

   ```console
   docker ps -a
   ```

4. Create a new ‘HelloWorld’ image that includes the changes in the first container you ran. To do so, run the [docker commit](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) command, replacing `<containerid>` with the ID of your container:

   ```console
   docker commit <containerid> helloworld
   ```

   When completed, you now have a custom image that contains the hello world script. This can be seen with the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command.

   ```console
   docker images
   ```

   Here's an example of the output:

   ```console
   REPOSITORY                             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   helloworld                             latest              a1064f2ec798        10 seconds ago      258MB
   mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver   1809                2b9c381d0911        3 weeks ago         256MB
   ```

5. Finally, run the new container by using the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command with the `--rm` parameter that automatically removes the container once the command line (cmd.exe) stops.

   ```console
   docker run --rm helloworld cmd.exe /s /c type Hello.txt
   ```
   The result is that Docker created a container from the 'HelloWorld' image, Docker started an instance of cmd.exe in the container, and the cmd.exe read our file and output the contents to the shell. As the final step, Docker stopped and removed the container.

## Run a Windows container using Windows Admin Center

You can use Windows Admin Center to run your containers locally. Specifically, you use the the Containers extension of your Windows Admin Center instance to run the containers. First, open the container host you want to manage, and in the Tools pane, select the **Containers** extension. Then, select the **Images** tab inside the Container extension under **Container Host**.

If your host doesn't have a base container image, select the **Pull** option to open the **Pull Container Image** settings:

![Pull Container Image settings window](./media/WAC-Pull.png)

In the **Pull Container Image** settings, provide the image URL and the tag. If you aren't certain which image to pull, Windows Admin Center provides a list of common images from Microsoft. You can also provide the credentials to pull an image from a private repository. Once you fill out the necessary information, click **Pull**. Windows Admin Center will start the pull process on the container host. After the download is complete, you should see the new image on the **Images** tab.

Select the image you want to run, and click **Run**.

On the **Run** menu, set up the configuration for the container, such as the container name, the isolation type, which ports to publish, and memory and CPU allocation. Additionally, you can append Docker run commands that are not in the UI, such as -v for persistent volume. For more information on available Docker run parameters, review the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).

Once you have finished the configuration for the container, click **Run**. You can see the status of the running containers on the **Containers** tab:

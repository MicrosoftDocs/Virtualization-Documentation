# Dockerfile on Windows

The Docker engine includes tools that automate container image creation. While you can create container images manually by running the `docker commit` command, adopting an automated image creation process has many benefits, including:

- Storing container images as code.
- Rapid and precise recreation of container images for maintenance and upgrade purposes.
- Continuous integration between container images and the development cycle.

The Docker components that drive this automation are the Dockerfile, and the `docker build` command.

The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions needed to create a new container image. These instructions include identification of an existing image to be used as a base, commands to be run during the image creation process, and a command that will run when new instances of the container image are deployed.

Docker build is the Docker engine command that consumes a Dockerfile and triggers the image creation process.

This topic will show you how to use Dockerfiles with Windows containers, understand their basic syntax, and what the most common Dockerfile instructions are.

This document will discuss the concept of container images and container image layers. If you want to learn more about images and image layering, see [container base images](../manage-containers/container-base-images.md).

For a complete look at Dockerfiles, see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

## Basic Syntax

In its most basic form, a Dockerfile can be very simple. The following example creates a new image, which includes IIS, and a ‘hello world’ site. This example includes comments (indicated with a `#`), that explain each step. Subsequent sections of this article will go into more detail on Dockerfile syntax rules, and Dockerfile instructions.

>[!NOTE]
>A Dockerfile must be created with no extension. To do this in Windows, create the file with your editor of choice, then save it with the notation "Dockerfile" (including the quotes).

```dockerfile
# Sample Dockerfile

# Indicates that the windowsservercore image will be used as the base image.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

# Metadata indicating an image maintainer.
LABEL maintainer="jshelton@contoso.com"

# Uses dism.exe to install the IIS role.
RUN dism.exe /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:iis-webserver /NoRestart

# Creates an HTML file and adds content to this file.
RUN echo "Hello World - Dockerfile" > c:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html

# Sets a command or process that will run each time a container is run from the new image.
CMD [ "cmd" ]
```

For additional examples of Dockerfiles for Windows, see the [Dockerfile for Windows repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-container-samples).

## Instructions

Dockerfile instructions provide the Docker Engine the instructions it needs to create a container image. These instructions are performed one-by-one and in order. The following examples are the most commonly used instructions in Dockerfiles. For a complete list of Dockerfile instructions, see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

### FROM

The `FROM` instruction sets the container image that will be used during the new image creation process. For instance, when using the instruction `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore`, the resulting image is derived from, and has a dependency on, the Windows Server Core base OS image. If the specified image is not present on the system where the Docker build process is being run, the Docker engine will attempt to download the image from a public or private image registry.

The FROM instruction's format goes like this:

```dockerfile
FROM <image>
```

Here's an example of the FROM command:

To download the ltsc2019 version windows server core from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR):
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019
```

For more detailed information, see the [FROM reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from).

### RUN

The `RUN` instruction specifies commands to be run, and captured into the new container image. These commands can include items such as installing software, creating files and directories, and creating environment configuration.

The RUN instruction goes like this:

```dockerfile
# exec form

RUN ["<executable>", "<param 1>", "<param 2>"]

# shell form

RUN <command>
```

The difference between the exec and shell form is in how the `RUN` instruction is executed. When using the exec form, the specified program is run explicitly.

Here's an example of the exec form:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN ["powershell", "New-Item", "c:/test"]
```

The resulting image runs the `powershell New-Item c:/test` command:

```dockerfile
docker history doc-exe-method

IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                    SIZE                COMMENT
b3452b13e472        2 minutes ago       powershell New-Item c:/test   30.76 MB
```

To contrast, the following example runs the same operation in shell form:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN powershell New-Item c:\test
```

The resulting image has a run instruction of `cmd /S /C powershell New-Item c:\test`.

```dockerfile
docker history doc-shell-method

IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                              SIZE                COMMENT
062a543374fc        19 seconds ago      cmd /S /C powershell New-Item c:\test   30.76 MB
```

### Considerations for using RUN with Windows

On Windows, when using the `RUN` instruction with the exec format, backslashes must be escaped.

```dockerfile
RUN ["powershell", "New-Item", "c:\\test"]
```

When the target program is a Windows installer, you'll need to extract the setup through the `/x:<directory>` flag before you can launch the actual (silent) installation procedure. You must also wait for the command to exit before you do anything else. Otherwise, the process will end prematurely without installing anything. For details, please consult the example below.

#### Examples of using RUN with Windows

The following example Dockerfile uses DISM to install IIS in the container image:

```dockerfile
RUN dism.exe /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:iis-webserver /NoRestart
```

This example installs the Visual Studio redistributable package. `Start-Process` and the `-Wait` parameter are used to run the installer. This ensures that the installation completes before moving on to the next instruction in the Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
RUN powershell.exe -Command Start-Process c:\vcredist_x86.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet' -Wait
```

For detailed information on the RUN instruction, see the [RUN reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run).

### COPY

The `COPY` instruction copies files and directories to the container's file system. The files and directories must be in a path relative to the Dockerfile.

The `COPY` instruction's format goes like this:

```dockerfile
COPY <source> <destination>
```

If either source or destination includes white space, enclose the path in square brackets and double quotes, as shown in the following example:

```dockerfile
COPY ["<source>", "<destination>"]
```

#### Considerations for using COPY with Windows

On Windows, the destination format must use forward slashes. For example, these are valid `COPY` instructions:

```dockerfile
COPY test1.txt /temp/
COPY test1.txt c:/temp/
```

Meanwhile, the following format with backslashes won't work:

```dockerfile
COPY test1.txt c:\temp\
```

#### Examples of using COPY with Windows

The following example adds the contents of the source directory to a directory named `sqllite` in the container image:

```dockerfile
COPY source /sqlite/
```

The following example will add all files that begin with config to the `c:\temp` directory of the container image:

```dockerfile
COPY config* c:/temp/
```

For more detailed information about the `COPY` instruction, see the [COPY reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy).

### ADD

The ADD instruction is like the COPY instruction, but with even more capabilities. In addition to copying files from the host into the container image, the `ADD` instruction can also copy files from a remote location with a URL specification.

The `ADD` instruction's format goes like this:

```dockerfile
ADD <source> <destination>
```

If either the source or destination include white space, enclose the path in square brackets and double quotes:

```dockerfile
ADD ["<source>", "<destination>"]
```

#### Considerations for running ADD with Windows

On Windows, the destination format must use forward slashes. For example, these are valid `ADD` instructions:

```dockerfile
ADD test1.txt /temp/
ADD test1.txt c:/temp/
```

Meanwhile, the following format with backslashes won't work:

```dockerfile
ADD test1.txt c:\temp\
```

Additionally, on Linux the `ADD` instruction will expand compressed packages on copy. This functionality is not available in Windows.

#### Examples of using ADD with Windows

The following example adds the contents of the source directory to a directory named `sqllite` in the container image:

```dockerfile
ADD source /sqlite/
```

The following example will add all files that begin with "config" to the `c:\temp` directory of the container image.

```dockerfile
ADD config* c:/temp/
```

The following example will download Python for Windows into the `c:\temp` directory of the container image.

```dockerfile
ADD https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe /temp/python-3.5.1.exe
```

For more detailed information about the `ADD` instruction, see the [ADD reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add).

### WORKDIR

The `WORKDIR` instruction sets a working directory for other Dockerfile instructions, such as `RUN`, `CMD`, and also the working directory for running instances of the container image.

The `WORKDIR` instruction's format goes like this:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR <path to working directory>
```

#### Considerations for using WORKDIR with Windows

On Windows, if the working directory includes a backslash, it must be escaped.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR c:\\windows
```

**Examples**

```dockerfile
WORKDIR c:\\Apache24\\bin
```

For detailed information on the `WORKDIR` instruction, see the [WORKDIR reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir).

### CMD

The `CMD` instruction sets the default command to be run when deploying an instance of the container image. For instance, if the container will be hosting an NGINX web server, the `CMD` might include instructions to start the web server with a command like `nginx.exe`. If multiple `CMD` instructions are specified in a Dockerfile, only the last is evaluated.

The `CMD` instruction's format goes like this:

```dockerfile
# exec form

CMD ["<executable", "<param>"]

# shell form

CMD <command>
```

#### Considerations for using CMD with Windows

On Windows, file paths specified in the `CMD` instruction must use forward slashes or have escaped backslashes `\\`. The following are valid `CMD` instructions:

```dockerfile
# exec form

CMD ["c:\\Apache24\\bin\\httpd.exe", "-w"]

# shell form

CMD c:\\Apache24\\bin\\httpd.exe -w
```

However, the following format without the proper slashes will not work:

```dockerfile
CMD c:\Apache24\bin\httpd.exe -w
```

For more detailed information about the `CMD` instruction, see the [CMD reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd).

## Escape character

In many cases a Dockerfile instruction will need to span multiple lines. To do this, you can use an escape character. The default Dockerfile escape character is a backslash `\`. However, because the backslash is also a file path separator in Windows, using it to span multiple lines can cause problems. To get around this, you can use a parser directive to change the default escape character. For more information about parser directives, see [Parser directives](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#parser-directives).

The following example shows a single RUN instruction that spans multiple lines using the default escape character:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN powershell.exe -Command \
    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; \
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe -OutFile c:\python-3.5.1.exe ; \
    Start-Process c:\python-3.5.1.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1' -Wait ; \
    Remove-Item c:\python-3.5.1.exe -Force
```

To modify the escape character, place an escape parser directive on the very first line of the Dockerfile. This can be seen in the following example.

>[!NOTE]
>Only two values can be used as escape characters: `\` and `` ` ``.

```dockerfile
# escape=`

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN powershell.exe -Command `
    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; `
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe -OutFile c:\python-3.5.1.exe ; `
    Start-Process c:\python-3.5.1.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1' -Wait ; `
    Remove-Item c:\python-3.5.1.exe -Force
```

For more information about the escape parser directive, see [Escape parser directive](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#escape).

## PowerShell in Dockerfile

### PowerShell cmdlets

PowerShell cmdlets can be run in a Dockerfile with the `RUN` operation.

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN powershell -command Expand-Archive -Path c:\apache.zip -DestinationPath c:\
```

### REST calls

PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet can be useful when gathering information or files from a web service. For instance, if you build an image that includes Python, you can set `$ProgressPreference` to `SilentlyContinue` to achieve faster downloads, as shown in the following example.

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN powershell.exe -Command \
  $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; \
  $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; \
  Invoke-WebRequest https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe -OutFile c:\python-3.5.1.exe ; \
  Start-Process c:\python-3.5.1.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1' -Wait ; \
  Remove-Item c:\python-3.5.1.exe -Force
```

>[!NOTE]
>`Invoke-WebRequest` also works in Nano Server.

Another option for using PowerShell to download files during the image creation process is to use the .NET WebClient library. This can increase download performance. The following example downloads the Python software, using the WebClient library.

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

RUN powershell.exe -Command \
  $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; \
  (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe','c:\python-3.5.1.exe') ; \
  Start-Process c:\python-3.5.1.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1' -Wait ; \
  Remove-Item c:\python-3.5.1.exe -Force
```

>[!NOTE]
>Nano Server does not currently support WebClient.

### PowerShell scripts

In some cases, it may be helpful to copy a script into the containers you use during the image creation process, then run the script from within the container.

>[!NOTE]
>This will limit any image layer caching and decrease the Dockerfile's readability.

This example copies a script from the build machine into the container using the `ADD` instruction. This script is then run using the RUN instruction.

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019
ADD script.ps1 /windows/temp/script.ps1
RUN powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass c:\windows\temp\script.ps1
```

## Docker build

Once a Dockerfile has been created and saved to disk, you can run `docker build` to create the new image. The `docker build` command takes several optional parameters and a path to the Dockerfile. For complete documentation on Docker Build, including a list of all build options, see the [build reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#build).

The format of the `docker build` command goes like this:

```dockerfile
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH
```

For example, the following command will create an image named "iis."

```dockerfile
docker build -t iis .
```

When the build process has been initiated, the output will indicate status and return any thrown errors.

```dockerfile
C:\> docker build -t iis .

Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
Step 1 : FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019

Step 2 : RUN dism /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:iis-webserver /NoRestart
 ---> Running in ae8759fb47db

The result is a new container image, which in this example is named "iis."

```dockerfile

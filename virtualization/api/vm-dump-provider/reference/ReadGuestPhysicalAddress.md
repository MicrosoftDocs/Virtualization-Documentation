# ReadGuestPhysicalAddress function

Reads from the saved state file the given guest physical address range and then it is written into the supplied buffer. If BytesRead returns something lower than BufferSize, then the end of memory has been reached.

    _Out_writes_bytes_(BufferSize) LPVOID   Buffer,
    _In_        UINT32                      BufferSize,
    _Out_opt_   UINT32*                     BytesRead
    );

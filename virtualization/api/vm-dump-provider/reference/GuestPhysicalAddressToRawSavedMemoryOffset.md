# GuestPhysicalAddressToRawSavedMemoryOffset function

Translates the given guest physical address to a raw saved memory offset. This is specially useful if callers need to read a memory range directly from all of the guest's saved memory starting in the saved memory address equivalent to the supplied guest physical address. Translation from raw saved memory offset to physical address is not supported.

## Syntax

```C
HRESULT
WINAPI
GuestPhysicalAddressToRawSavedMemoryOffset(
    _In_    VM_SAVED_STATE_DUMP_HANDLE      VmSavedStateDumpHandle,
    _In_    GUEST_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS          PhysicalAddress,
    _Out_   UINT64*                         RawSavedMemoryOffset
    );
```

## Parameters

`PhysicalAddress`

`RawSavedMemoryOffset`

Returns the raw saved memory offset for a given physical address.

# Windows Hypervisor Platform API samples

We've provided two samples written in C++ to demonstrate usage of Windows Hypervisor Platform APIs.

## x64

You can find the x64 sample on our [Github repo here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/blob/main/virtualization/api/hypervisor-platform/samples/WinHvSampleAmd64.cpp).

## ARM64

> [!NOTE]
> Experimental support for WHP on ARM64 is available starting with Windows build 26085. Use the latest builds from the Windows Insider Canary channel to get updates and fixes.
>
> The ARM64 APIs are subject to change.

You can find the ARM64 sample on our [Github repo here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/blob/main/virtualization/api/hypervisor-platform/samples/WinHvSampleArm64.cpp).

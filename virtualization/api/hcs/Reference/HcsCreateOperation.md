# HcsCreateOperation

## Description

Creates a new operation.

## Syntax

```cpp
HCS_OPERATION WINAPI
HcsCreateOperation(
    _In_opt_ HCS_OPERATION_COMPLETION callback
    _In_opt_ void*                    context
    );
```

## Parameters

`callback`

Optional pointer to an [`HCS_OPERATION_COMPLETION`](./HCS_OPERATION_COMPLETION.md) callback to be invoked when the operation completes.

`context`

Optional pointer to a context that is passed to the callback.

## Return Values

Returns the `HCS_OPERATION` handle to the newly created operation on success, `NULL` if resources required for the operation couldn't be allocated. It is the responsibility of the caller to release the operation using [`HcsCloseOperation`](./HcsCloseOperation.md) once it is no longer used.

## Remarks

Refer to the [async model sample code](./AsyncModelSample.md) for details on how to use HCS operations.

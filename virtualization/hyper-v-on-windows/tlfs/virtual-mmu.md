# Virtual MMU

The virtual machine interface exposed by each partition includes a memory management unit (MMU). The virtual MMU exposed by hypervisor partitions is generally compatible with existing MMUs.

## Virtual MMU Overview

Virtual processors expose virtual memory and a virtual TLB (translation look-aside buffer), which caches translations from virtual addresses to (guest) physical addresses. As with the TLB on a logical processor, the virtual TLB is a non-coherent cache, and this non-coherence is visible to guests. The hypervisor exposes operations to flush the TLB. Guests can use these operations to remove potentially inconsistent entries and make virtual address translations predictable.

### Compatibility

The virtual MMU exposed by the hypervisor is generally compatible with the physical MMU found within an x64 processor. The following guest-observable differences exist:

- The CR3.PWT and CR3.PCD bits may not be supported in some hypervisor implementations. On such implementations, any attempt by the guest to set these flags through a MOV to CR3 instruction or a task gate switch will be ignored. Attempts to set these bits programmatically through HvSetVpRegisters or HvSwitchVirtualAddressSpace may result in an error.
- The PWT and PCD bits within a leaf page table entry (for example, a PTE for 4-K pages and a PDE for large pages) specify the cacheability of the page being mapped. The PAT, PWT, and PCD bits within non-leaf page table entries indicate the cacheability of the next page table in the hierarchy. Some hypervisor implementations may not support these flags. On such implementations, all page table accesses performed by the hypervisor are done by using write-back cache attributes. This affects, in particular, accessed and dirty bits written to the page table entries. If the guest sets the PAT, PWT, or PCD bits within non-leaf page table entries, an “unsupported feature” message may be generated when a virtual processor accesses a page that is mapped by that page table.
- The CR0.CD (cache disable) bit may not be supported in some hypervisor implementations. On such implementations, the CR0.CD bit must be set to 0. Any attempt by the guest to set this flag through a MOV to CR0 instruction will be ignored. Attempts to set this bit programmatically through HvSetVpRegisters will result in an error.
- The PAT (page address type) MSR is a per-VP register. However, when all the virtual processors in a partition set the PAT MSR to the same value, the new effect becomes a partition-wide effect.
- For reasons of security and isolation, the INVD instruction will be virtualized to act like a WBINVD instruction, with some differences. For security purposes, CLFLUSH should be used instead.

### Legacy TLB Management Operations

The x64 architecture provides several ways to manage the processor’s TLBs. The following mechanisms are virtualized by the hypervisor:

- The INVLPG instruction invalidates the translation for a single page from the processor’s TLB. If the specified virtual address was originally mapped as a 4-K page, the translation for this page is removed from the TLB. If the specified virtual address was originally mapped as a “large page” (either 2 MB or 4 MB, depending on the MMU mode), the translation for the entire large page is removed from the TLB. The INVLPG instruction flushes both global and non-global translations. Global translations are defined as those which have the “global” bit set within the page table entry.
- The MOV to CR3 instruction and task switches that modify CR3 invalidate translations for all non-global pages within the processor’s TLB.
- A MOV to CR4 instruction that modifies the CR4.PGE (global page enable) bit, the CR4.PSE (page size extensions) bit, or CR4.PAE (page address extensions) bit invalidates all translations (global and non-global) within the processor’s TLB.

Note that all of these invalidation operations affect only one processor. To invalidate translations on other processors, software must use a software-based “TLB shoot-down” mechanism (typically implemented by using inter-process interrupts).

### Virtual TLB Enhancements

In addition to supporting the legacy TLB management mechanisms described earlier, the hypervisor also supports a set of enhancements that enable a guest to manage the virtual TLB more efficiently. These enhanced operations can be used interchangeably with legacy TLB management operations.

The hypervisor supports the following hypercalls to invalidate TLBs:

| Hypercall                                                                           | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [HvCallFlushVirtualAddressSpace](hypercalls/HvCallFlushVirtualAddressSpace.md)      | Invalidates all virtual TLB entries that belong to a specified address space.    |
| [HvCallFlushVirtualAddressSpaceEx](hypercalls/HvCallFlushVirtualAddressSpaceEx.md)  | Similar to HvCallFlushVirtualAddressSpace, takes a sparse VP set as input.    |
| [HvCallFlushVirtualAddressList](hypercalls/HvCallFlushVirtualAddressList.md)        | Invalidates a portion of the specified address space.    |
| [HvCallFlushVirtualAddressListEx](hypercalls/HvCallFlushVirtualAddressListEx.md)    | Similar to HvCallFlushVirtualAddressList, takes a sparse VP set as input.    |

On some systems (those with sufficient virtualization support in hardware), the legacy TLB management instructions may be faster for local or remote (cross-processor) TLB invalidation. Guests who are interested in optimal performance should use the CPUID leaf 0x40000004 to determine which behaviors to implement using hypercalls:

- UseHypercallForAddressSpaceSwitch: If this flag is set, the caller should assume that it’s faster to use HvCallSwitchAddressSpace to switch between address spaces. If this flag is clear, a MOV to CR3 instruction is recommended.
- UseHypercallForLocalFlush: If this flag is set, the caller should assume that it’s faster to use hypercalls (as opposed to INVLPG or MOV to CR3) to flush one or more pages from the virtual TLB.
- UseHypercallForRemoteFlushAndLocalFlushEntire: If this flag is set, the caller should assume that it’s faster to use hypercalls (as opposed to using guest-generated inter-processor interrupts) to flush one or more pages from the virtual TLB.

## Memory Cache Control Overview

The hypervisor supports guest-defined cacheability settings for pages mapped within the guest’s GVA space. For a detailed description of available cacheability settings and their meanings, refer to the Intel or AMD documentation.

When a virtual processor accesses a page through its GVA space, the hypervisor honors the cache attribute bits (PAT, PWT, and PCD) within the guest page table entry used to map the page. These three bits are used as an index into the partition’s PAT (page address type) register to look up the final cacheability setting for the page.

Pages accessed directly through the GPA space (for example, when paging is disabled because CR0.PG is cleared) use a cacheability defined by the MTRRs. If the hypervisor implementation doesn’t support virtual MTRRs, WB cacheability is assumed.

### Mixing Cache Types between a Partition and the Hypervisor

Guests should be aware that some pages within its GPA space may be accessed by the hypervisor. The following list, while not exhaustive, provides several examples:

- page that contains input or output parameters for a hypercall
- All overlay pages including the hypercall page, SynIC SIEF and SIM pages, and stats pages

The hypervisor always performs accesses to hypercall parameters and overlay pages by using the WB cacheability setting.

# Hyper-V on Windows 11 

Many versions of Windows 11 include the Hyper-V virtualization technology. Hyper-V enables running virtualized computer systems on top of a physical host. These virtualized systems can be used and managed just as if they were physical computer systems, however they exist in virtualized and isolated environment. Special software called a hypervisor manages access between the virtual systems and the physical hardware resources. Virtualization enables quick deployment of computer systems, a way to quickly restore systems to a previously known good state, and the ability to migrate systems between physical hosts.

The following documents detail the Hyper-V feature in Windows 11, provide a guided quick start, and also contain links to further resources and community forums.

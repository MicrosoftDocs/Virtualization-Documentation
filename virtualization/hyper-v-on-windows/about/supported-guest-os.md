# Supported Windows guests

This article lists the operating system combinations supported in Hyper-V on Windows.  It also serves as an introduction to integration services and other factors in support.

Microsoft has tested these host/guest combinations.  Issues with these combinations may receive attention from Product Support Services.

Microsoft provides support in the following manner:

* Issues found in Microsoft operating systems and in integration services are supported by Microsoft support.

* For issues found in other operating systems that have been certified by the operating system vendor to run on Hyper-V, support is provided by the vendor.

* For issues found in other operating systems, Microsoft submits the issue to the multi-vendor support community, [TSANet](http://www.tsanet.org/).

In order to be supported, all operating systems (guest and host) must be up to date.  Check Windows Update for critical updates.

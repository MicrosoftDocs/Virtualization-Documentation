# Follow us on Twitter and get a chance to win a Zune HD

I now have the final list of sessions that I will be attending at VMworld. As I [noted last time](https://blogs.technet.com/virtualization/archive/2009/08/26/vmworld-2009-an-oppurtunity-to-meet-our-customers.aspx) I had a lot of waitlists which it now appears I have not made the cut for most of the sessions. That means I will be at our booth (#2422) almost all of today (Aug 31, 2009) and at the times when I am not attending a session. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />  There is a great opportunity to win a [32GB Zune HD](https://store.microsoft.com/microsoft/Zune-HD-32GB/product/41941DC9). All you have to do is to follow the [Microsoft Virtualization experts](https://events.microsoft.com/en-us/allevents/?language=English&clientTimeZone=1) on Twitter. By the way this is open to folks who are not attending VMworld as well. So follow along with us!! You can follow me [here](https://twitter.com/Vtango).  I am heading over to the Moscone Center to register and see if I can get into some of the labs being offered today.

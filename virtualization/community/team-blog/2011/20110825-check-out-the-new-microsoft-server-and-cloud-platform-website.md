# Check out the New Microsoft Server and Cloud Platform Website!

We’re pleased to announce the launch of the new [Microsoft Server and Cloud Platform website](http://bit.ly/omgt2U)   
([http://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud](http://bit.ly/omgt2U)).  

The new site is a comprehensive source for information relating to our private cloud  
and virtualization solutions, as well as other solutions based on Windows  
Server, System Center, Forefront and related products.  It is designed to  
help connect you to relevant information across Microsoft web destinations,  
including TechNet, MSDN, Pinpoint and more - making it a great place to  
understand what we offer, why you should consider it and how to get started.  
  
Enjoy the new site and stay tuned to the blog for the latest Server & Cloud  
Platform updates!

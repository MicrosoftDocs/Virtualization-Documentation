# Uncle TechEd Wants You!

The Microsoft TechEd Twitter Army is looking for recruits to twitter off the show floor during our premier TechEd event running May 16-19 in Atlanta. If you’re going to the show and want your opinions heard, be sure to check in at the Social Media area in the Microsoft Server & Cloud Platform Booth on Monday afternoon at 12:30 pm.  Recruits who do well on the Twitter front lines will **compete for an Xbox 360 + Kinnect package and other prizes** to be handed out at a private Twitter Army event happening Thursday at 2 pm. Those that attend the 12:30pm Tweetup will also receive a special Twitter Army badge!   Don’t forget, and remember that Uncle TechEd Wants You!

# Runbooks in Hyper-V Replica

System Center 2012 Orchestrator provides a powerful workflow management solution which allows IT administrators to automate different tasks exposed by the platform. At the heart of the Orchestrator is a set of **Runbooks** which outline the sequence of activities for a given task. A number of resources are available on Technet which explain the concept and provide guidance on building these Runbooks.  

**Charles Joy** is a Senior Program Manager with the Windows Server & System Center group in Microsoft who has authored a set of Hyper-V Replica sample Runbooks which can be downloaded for free from [TechNet Galleries](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Orchestrated-HVR-Planned-5ebecfc1). In his blog post <https://blogs.technet.com/b/building_clouds/archive/2013/02/11/automation-orchestrating-hyper-v-replica-with-system-center-for-planned-failover.aspx> he explains the high level concepts and also shows a Planned Failover in action. 

Download the runbook and share your experience with us – we would love to hear your feedback!

# TechEd North America 2012


Posting this on behalf of **Jeff Woolsey** who delivered an amazing demo in the Day 1 Keynote address by **Satya Nadella.**

The video is available **here** and the transcript for the keynote address is available **here**.
  
  
Some key takeaways from Jeff's presentation:

  * 64 virtual processors in a VM
  * **985,000 IOPs** from a single Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V VM 
    * 4k Random IO; Queue Depth 32, 40 concurrent threads
    * VMware tops out at 300,000 per VM; needs 6 VMs to achieve this
  * Offloaded Data Transfer ODX (file copies of **1 GigaBYTE** **per second** ). Yes folks, copy a 10 GB file in 10 seconds.
    * Works with SANs and the new Windows Server 2012 File Server
  * Cisco Nexus 1000v for Hyper-V
  * PowerShell as the engine for Run Book Automation with Hyper-V Replica
  * Extending on premise private cloud to service provider

Yesterday, Vipul Shah, a Senior Product Manager with the Virtualization Team, [guest posted](http://blogs.technet.com/virtplanet/archive/2010/01/26/guest-blog-sql-server-consolidation-with-microsoft-virtualization.aspx) on Virtualization Planet about how Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V and System Center is a great platform for running SQL Server consolidated workloads. He pointed to a newly released [video](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/server-consolidation.aspx) by Ted Kummert, Senior Vice President, Microsoft Business Platform Division that outlines how virtualization enables consolidation. This is exciting as we ran some performance tests against a complex stock trading application using a machine with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) and saw good performance throughout the tests. We recently discussed in the _Best Practices for SQL Server Virtualization_ webcast (click [here](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032428764&EventCategory=5&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US)) and in the _SQL Server Consolidation Guidance_ (click [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee819082.aspx)) the results of those tests, and guidance on running SQL as a virtual machine. Take a look at the [post](http://blogs.technet.com/virtplanet/archive/2010/01/26/guest-blog-sql-server-consolidation-with-microsoft-virtualization.aspx) for more details.

# Dress up your office wall with the Hyper-V component architecture poster

Hi, this is Bryon Surace again.  I’m a senior program manager on the Windows virtualization team at Microsoft. 

 

I wanted to draw your attention to the new [Hyper-V Component Architecture Poster](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=5567b22a-8c47-4840-a88d-23146fd93151).   

[Hyper-V Component Architecture Poster](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=5567b22a-8c47-4840-a88d-23146fd93151)

The poster is a great visual tool to help in the understanding of the key features and components of the Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2.  It highlights key Hyper-V components including:

§  Architecture

§  Virtual Networking 

§  Virtual Machine Snapshots 

§  Live Migration

§  Storage Interfaces

§  Storage Types

§  Storage Location and Paths

§  Import and Export

 

This large-format poster provides practical visual depictions of the Windows Hypervisor, live migration process, cluster shared volumes architecture, VMQ data paths, disk storage I/O path, and much more.

 

Download, Print, and Enjoy!

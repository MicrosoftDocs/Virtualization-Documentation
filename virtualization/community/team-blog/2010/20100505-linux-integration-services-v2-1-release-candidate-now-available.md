# "Linux Integration Services v2.1 Release Candidate Now Available"

In March, we had announced the beta release of the Linux Integration Services for Microsoft Hyper-V, which added support for SMP-based virtual machines, timesync, and integrated shutdown. Today we're announcing the release candidate (RC) version of the integration services.

In addition to the features that were present in the beta release, the following features have been added for this release candidate:

·         **Heartbeat:** This provides a way for the host to detect if the guest is still running and responsive. **

**

·          **Pluggable Time Source:** A pluggable clock source module is included for a more accurate time source to the guest.

 **

This version of the integration services for Hyper-V can be downloaded from [here](https://connect.microsoft.com/InvitationUse.aspx?ProgramID=1863&InvitationID=LNIS-T47Q-B7MP&SiteID=495), and supports Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 / 5.3 / 5.4 / 5.5.

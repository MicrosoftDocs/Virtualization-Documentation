Wow, 11,000 attendees, press, analysts and speakers here at TechEd. That’s a testimony to the passion, and excitement that this generates amongst our customers and partners. 

 

Day 1 got off to a flying start with Bob Muglia and his inimitable style.  For those who did not get a chance to view the keynote you can catch the recording at 

[http://www.msteched.com/2010/NorthAmerica/Keynote01](http://www.msteched.com/2010/NorthAmerica/Keynote01). Some really cool demos of System Center Virtual Machine Manager vNext and how we are taking our learning’s from running our datacenters and providing that technology to you (@ the 16 minute mark). 

 

I was at the booth for almost the entire day and the traffic was great. We had lots of customers who came over and had great detailed technical conversations on their deployments with Hyper-V and SCVMM. Quote of the day “I love Hyper-V and am moving over 1800-2000 servers running VMware”. 

 

There were a few questions from customers on network failover and load balancing. I want to take this opportunity to point out that our partners such as 

[Intel](http://www.intel.com/support/network/sb/cs-009747.htm) and Broadcom have powerful solutions for NIC teaming. 

 

The bummer was when we lost Internet connectivity for a while at the convention center. Thankfully it was restored before the end of the day and we could return to a sense of digital comfort and connectivity. 

 

Day 2 has a plethora of sessions on Virtualization and Management. Below is what we have in store for you today. Today’s is the big day for details on Dynamic Memory and RemoteFX.

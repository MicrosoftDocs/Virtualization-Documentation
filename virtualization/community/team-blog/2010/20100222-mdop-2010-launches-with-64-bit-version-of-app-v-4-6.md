# MDOP 2010 Launches, with 64-bit version of App-V 4.6

Earlier today we [announced](http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/business/default.aspx "MDOP blog post") important updates for IT pros considering Windows 7 deployment. Specifically, we released **Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP) 2010** , which includes **App-V 4.6** , supporting Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 for RDS and Office 2010. The App-V support for Office 2010 means you can do a one-touch deployment and don't have to wait for Office 2010 to deploy Windows 7.

 

Additionally we released the **MED-V 1.0 SP1 Release Candidate** , which creates managed virtual machines running previous versions of Windows and Internet Explorer so users can upgrade to Windows 7. The RTM version of MED-V 1.0 service pack 1 will be available in April, but you can start today by downloading the release candidate.

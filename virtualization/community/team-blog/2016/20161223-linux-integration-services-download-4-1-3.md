# Linux Integration Services Download 4.1.3

We've just published an update for the Linux Integration Services download. This release includes a series of upstream updates and adds compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Oracle Linux RHCK 7.3. The LIS 4.1.3 download is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download). The LIS download is not required for Linux distributions that have built-in LIS, as described in ["Which Linux Integration Services should I use in my Linux VMs?"](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/virtualization/which-linux-integration-services-should-i-use-in-my-linux-vms/ba-p/382304) Linux Integration Services is an open source project that is part of the Linux Kernel, and we welcome public involvement with the LIS download on [GitHub](https://github.com/LIS/lis-next).

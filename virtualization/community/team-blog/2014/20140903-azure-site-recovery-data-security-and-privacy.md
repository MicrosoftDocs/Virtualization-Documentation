# Azure Site Recovery - Data Security and Privacy

Microsoft is committed to ensuring the Privacy and Security of our customer’s data whenever it crosses on-premises boundaries and into Microsoft Azure. Azure Site Recovery, a cloud-based Disaster Recovery Service that enables protection and orchestrated recovery of your virtualized workloads across on-premises private clouds or directly into Azure, has been designed ground up to align with [Microsoft’s privacy and security commitment](https://aka.ms/asrsecurityblog_bradblog). 

_Specifically our promise is to ensure that:_

  * We encrypt customer data while in transit and at rest 
  * We use best-in-class industry cryptography to protect all channels, including Perfect Forward Secrecy and 2048-bit key lengths

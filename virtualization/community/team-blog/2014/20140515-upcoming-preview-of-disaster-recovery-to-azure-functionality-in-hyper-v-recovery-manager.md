# New functionality in Hyper-V Recovery Manager

In the coming weeks, we will Preview functionality within Hyper-V Recovery Manager to enable Microsoft Azure as a Disaster Recovery point for virtualized workloads. The new functionality will add support for secure and seamless management of failover and failback operations using Azure IaaS Virtual Machines, thereby enabling our customers to save precious CAPEX and ongoing OPEX incurred in managing a secondary site for Disaster Recovery. Our enhanced DRaaS offering further delivers on our promise of democratizing Disaster Recovery and of making it available to _everyone_ , _everywhere_. Hyper-V Recovery Manager provides enterprise-scale Disaster Recovery using a sing-click failover in the event of a disaster to an alternate enterprise data center or to an IaaS VM in Microsoft Azure. Application and Site Level Disaster Recovery is delivered via automation of overall DR workflow, smart networking, and frequent testing using DR Drills. 

 

We announced the Preview during TechEd 2014. For more details about the upcoming Preview and existing Hyper-V Recovery Manager functionality, check out the [**DCIM-B322**](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2014/DCIM-B322#fbid=?hashlink=fbid) session recording.

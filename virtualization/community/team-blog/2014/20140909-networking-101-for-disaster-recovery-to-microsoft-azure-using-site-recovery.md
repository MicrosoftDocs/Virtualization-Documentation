Head over to the Microsoft Azure blog to read our new blog that shows you how you can accomplish [Networking Infrastructure Setup for Microsoft Azure as a Disaster Recovery Site](https://aka.ms/virtualization_blog_e2a_networking). Using the example of a multi-tier application we show you how to setup the required networking infrastructure, establish network connectivity between on-premises and Azure and then conclude the post with more details on Test Failover and Planned Failover.

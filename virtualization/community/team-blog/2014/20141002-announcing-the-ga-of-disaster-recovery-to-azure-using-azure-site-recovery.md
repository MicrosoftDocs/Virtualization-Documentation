I am excited to [announce the GA of the Disaster Recovery to Azure using Azure Site Recovery](https://aka.ms/asr_ga_virtualizationblog). In addition to enabling _replication to_ and _recovery in_ Microsoft Azure, ASR enables automated protection of VMs, remote health monitoring, no-impact recovery plan testing, and single click orchestrated recovery - all backed by an enterprise-grade SLA.  The DR to Azure functionality in ASR builds on top of System Center Virtual Machine Manager, Windows Server Hyper-V Replica, and Microsoft Azure to ensure that our customers can leverage existing IT investments while still helping them optimize precious CAPEX and OPEX spent in building and managing secondary datacenter sites. 

The GA release also brings significant additions to the already expansive list of ASR’s DR to Azure features:

  * ***NEW*** **ASR Recovery Plans and Azure Automation** integrate to offer robust and simplified one-click orchestration of your DR plans  

  * ***NEW*** **Track Initial Replication Progress** as virtual machine data gets replicated to a customer-owned and managed geo-redundant Azure Storage account. This new feature is also available when configuring DR between on-premises private clouds across enterprise sites

  * ***NEW*** **Simplified Setup and Registration** streamlines the DR setup by removing the complexity of generating certificates and integrity keys needed to register your on-premises System Center Virtual Machine Manager server with your Site Recovery vault

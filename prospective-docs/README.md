# Prospective Documentation

This folder is home to documents that should probably exist somewhere but don't have a clear home.  The goal is to provide a low-stress way to propose content without worrying about its publication readiness.

> Warning:  The documentation here hasn't necessarily been reviewed and is very likely incomplete.  Do not assume it's correct.

If a document appears here, the documentation team and Hyper-V team will:

1.  Review the content and determine if it belongs in the documentation
2.  Determine where in the documentation this content belongs
3.  Collaborate with the original author to edit it and make it publication ready
4.  Publish the document when steps 1-3 have been completed.

> **Note:**  If you are a Microsoft employee/partner and want a similar process for NDA content, [contact the documentation team (e-mail)](mailto:HyperVContentOwners@microsoft.com?subject=Contribute NDA Content to Virtualization-Documentation&body=Proposed content:).

If you have questions or comments, feel free to [contact us](mailto:HyperVContentOwners@microsoft.com?subject=Virtualization-Documentation questions).
